          Despite all the morning caffeines and ghee-porota, I’m badly missing
          Ramadan. I’m missing the alluring scent of piyaju and beguni coming
          from the extremely adjacent neighbouring kitchen, while their sizzle
          keeps on being an equal delight to my ears. <br /><br />
          I’m missing that holy essence of midnight which magically entrapped my
          restrictive mind to attend to two more rakat of prayers. I’m missing
          the idyllic feeling of sitting on the prayer mat during dawn and
          listening to the zikr of the universe. Ramadan is a month that comes
          with gifts in form of feelings that cannot be fathomed, unless felt.
          <br /><br />
          While I might not be able to conjure all those feelings as Ramadan
          2021 is a past now, I can surely hope for Ramadan 2022 to come and sit
          sooner and cherish the memories I’ve made, till then!
