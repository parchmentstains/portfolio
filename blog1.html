          I‚Äôve developed this weird habit overtime: carrying books to almost
          everywhere! I believe this habit of mine has its roots in my boyhood,
          when I used to use teen fictions to escape the bitter realism of
          classrooms. The harangue of teachers in the sedative summer afternoons
          bothered me little because of these magic things. And that‚Äôs why,
          every night when I used to make my school bag for the next day, I used
          to shove down a fiction piece amidst the academics. The habit didn‚Äôt
          leave me alone! <br /><br />
          Even now whenever I go out, no matter how special or random the
          occasion is, if I don‚Äôt take a book with me, I feel unready. That made
          me start considering the size of my bags. Now when I think of buying a
          bag, first thing I consider: would it be able to make the biggest of
          my book fit it? If the answer is yes, I don‚Äôt wait another moment! And
          that might be the reason why I don‚Äôt have much purses! Anyways, enough
          of my bag-book-tale! <br /><br />
          Now let me present to you my first ever big collaboration moment and
          it‚Äôs with @lamodebd ! I‚Äôm really glad that they chose me bc it has
          been a dream project! AND needless to mention, when I was asked to
          choose the collaboration products, I did consider the size üòù but also
          my statement and hence this beautiful blush pink handbag üëú
          <br /><br />
          60% success of the shoot should be accredited to my very patient
          boyfriend @aryaninbytes who successfully refrained from throwing the
          camera at me on my constant bugging comments! I‚Äôm really hoping that
          you all would like it!
