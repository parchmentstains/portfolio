          The book that I’ve recently finished reading contains this beautiful
          quote by Blaise Pascal: “I love poverty because Jesus loved it. I love
          wealth because it affords me the means of helping the needy.” My
          instant reaction after reading this quotation was: Isn’t it something
          that I’ve always felt deep inside but never been able to articulate
          this properly and accurately?! <br /><br />
          When I was a kid, I used to wonder a lot on the ever existing socio
          economic differences between people and why Almighty chose to award
          some with more money than others. As the question was never asked to
          any elders, I never received any matured answer. But back in those
          days, I was very much curious about the Sunnah lifestyle. I guess it
          was some children’s book on Prophet Pbuh where I was finally able to
          get some answer to my question. <br /><br />
          Since then, I’ve tried to disburse no matter how much little the
          amount is and have tried to make sure that it goes to the ones who’re
          actually in need of it. I believe Almighty considers me worthy of
          being a fair distributor and I make every attempt at being so.
          <br /><br />
          While charity totally depends on person to person, I think if we all
          consider ourselves Almighty’s honoured agents and act accordingly, the
          world can surly be made a bit more beautiful.
